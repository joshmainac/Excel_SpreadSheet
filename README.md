# Excel_SpreadSheet
I imported this project from my gitlab account

Solution in SpreadSheet_Joshua_Long

This project was developed using a modular approach, where the project is divided into smaller, distinct parts or modules that can be developed and tested independently, with each module building upon the functionality of the previous ones. To see each module independently, check the tags HW4 to HW10.

1)In the first stage, you will create the basic parts of a spreadsheet application, including a user interface that allows the user to enter and edit cell values. This assignment lays the foundation for the rest of the project.

2)In the second stage, you will create an ExpressionTree class in a separate logic engine DLL that can parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions. The ExpressionTree class will have various methods to support this functionality. A standalone console application will be used to demo the functionality of the ExpressionTree class.

3)In the third stage, you will complete the implementation of the arithmetic expression parser in the ExpressionTree class, and integrate the ExpressionTree class into the spreadsheet application from the first stage. The console application from the second stage will still be used to demo the functionality of the ExpressionTree class.

4)In the fourth stage, you will modify the spreadsheet application from the first stage to have additional functionality, such as the ability to reference other cells in formulas and update cell values when referenced cells change.

5)In the fifth stage, you will incorporate the ExpressionTree class into the spreadsheet application to properly evaluate formulas when updating cell values. It will also involve updating cell values when other cells that they reference in formulas are changed.

6)In the sixth stage, you will add an undo and redo system to the spreadsheet application, as well as the ability to choose the background color of a cell. The undo system will support undo and redo actions for changing the cell's text or background color.

7)In the seventh stage, you will add loading and saving capabilities to the spreadsheet application, using an XML format to store the data.

8)In the eighth and final stage, you will add the ability to deal with problematic references in formulas, which may require some refactoring of the existing spreadsheet code.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
